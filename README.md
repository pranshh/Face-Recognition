# Face Recognition

This repository contains a Python script for face recognition using Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques.

## Description

The script uses the face_recognition, os, cv2, and imutils libraries to recognize faces from known and unknown images. It leverages deep learning, specifically a convolutional neural network (CNN), for the task of face recognition. The script also utilizes computer vision library, OpenCV, for image processing tasks.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python
* face_recognition library
* os library
* cv2 library
* imutils library

### Executing program

* Add images of known faces in the 'Known Faces' directory.
* Add images of unknown faces in the 'Unknown Faces' directory.
* Run the script:
    ```
    python facial_recog.py
